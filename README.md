Hi!

Today, I will use SQL to calculate E-commerce KPIs:
  1. Total revenue, total quantity, total order, Average revenue per month, Average revenue per order, Average revenue per quantity
  2. Monthly revenue & Month over Month (MoM) Growth rate(%)
  3. Total customers & average order per customer
  4. Number of new customers per month & running total new customers each month
  5. Monthly active customers(MAU) & Monht over Month (MoM) growth rate(%)
  6. Customer Cohort
  7. Customer Retention by Cohort
